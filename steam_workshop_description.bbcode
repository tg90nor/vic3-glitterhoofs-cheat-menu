Updated for v1.9

Based on https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3104523184 , which is again based on previous iterations of Advanced Cheat Menu.

I have started reworking the modifiers to make them dynamic, and give them better icons and tooltips.

Only in English at the moment, but I'm open to including translations.
